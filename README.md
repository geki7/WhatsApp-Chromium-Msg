I wanted to create a program that would automatically send a message to a specific person on WhatsApp in the background, every day at a predetermined time. I accomplished this by creating a task in Task Scheduler that runs the program daily at the desired time.

**1. Setting Up PuppeteerSharp:** I installed PuppeteerSharp via NuGet, as it allows me to automate and control a browser directly from my .NET code. 
	This library is key for interacting with WhatsApp Web, as it gives me control over Chrome/Chromium.

**2. Configuring Chromium:** Instead of relying on PuppeteerSharp’s default browser, I downloaded Chromium manually and pointed my code to its location. 
	This way, I could control the specific version of Chromium and ensure it opened with my user profile. 
	I set the Headless option to false so I could watch the interactions and debug in real-time.

**3. Automating the Message Process:** 
	I used PuppeteerSharp to open WhatsApp Web and locate the elements I needed, such as the contact search box. By typing in the contact name, I could find and click on the correct conversation.
 	Once in the chat, I used the Keyboard.TypeAsync method to simulate typing my message directly, then sent it with a simulated "Enter" press.

4.	**Handling Timing and Stability:** I added Task.Delay calls at crucial points to make sure the browser had enough time to load each element and execute the commands. This ensured the script didn’t close the browser 			before the message was sent, leading to a smoother, error-free automation.
