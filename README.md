I wanted to create a program that would automatically send a message to a specific person on WhatsApp in the background, every day at a predetermined time. I accomplished this by creating a task in Task Scheduler that runs the program daily at the desired time.

**1. Setting Up PuppeteerSharp**

**2. Configuring Chromium** 

**3. Automating the Message Process** 

**4. Handling Timing and Stability**
